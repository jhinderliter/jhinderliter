This is a second try of the starting git exercise. 

The first two steps was fine with add and commit. 

Then I went to 3rd steps of removing some text of change.

Then it stucks.

So, I am trying a new file to add and commit again.


Thsi is file number 2.

Below will be text to be removed for part two of the exericse.

OK, so far so good. Again, I find using the web online is much easier than using the one on my desktop using command. I practice several basic commands and it was working for a while until I got stuck on one error message keep saying the file cannot be updated. So, I actually delete the initial starter file and started this v2 file to do the exercise.
