This is the second file of trying to add onto git.

Otherwise, I do not really know how this work inbetween the Github and the local file changes

Ok, let's added few more lines to this files for the next commit try.

I find myself not picking up the habit of putting the -m stating the change to record what has been change. So, this will be confusing I am sure when there is actual project and several people needed to work on the same files from different times.
