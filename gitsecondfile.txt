This is the second file of trying to add onto git.

OK, I removed this line before and now this following line does not make sense anymore. I was saying that I am not very familar with this app and watching the videos really help a lot of getting to use the Git.

Otherwise, I do not really know how this work inbetween the Github and the local file changes

Ok, let's added few more lines to this files for the next commit try.

I find myself not picking up the habit of putting the -m stating the change to record what has been change. So, this will be confusing I am sure when there is actual project and several people needed to work on the same files from different times.

Also, I was using the desktop version using command before but I got stuck and finding an error message that I could not move forward anymore. So, I switch to using the web and I found this much easier to use than the desktop one actually.
